## Presentation
Content
The presentation tells a story about their
project, including the following:
✓ Selected topic 
✓ Reason why they selected their topic 
✓ Description of their source of data 
✓ Questions they hope to answer with the
data 
✓ Description of the data exploration phase
of the project 
✓ Description of the analysis phase of the
project 
✓ Technologies, languages, tools, and
algorithms used throughout the project
Slides Presentations are drafted in Google Slides


## Github
Master Branch All code in the master branch is productionready.
Master branch should include: 
✓ All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis 
✓ Most code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project

README.md 
README.md must include: 
✓ Description of the communication
protocols has been removed 
✓ Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but should be easy to follow and digest) 
✓ Link to Google Slides draft presentation
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as partof your outline, unless otherwise noted.
Individual Branches 
✓ At least one branch  for each team member ✓ Each team member has at least four
commits for the duration of the third segment
(12 total commits per person)

## Machine Learning Model
Team members submit the working code for
their machine learning model, as well as the
following:

✓ Description of data preprocessing 

✓ Description of feature engineering and the
feature selection, including their decisionmaking process 

PCA (reduction?¿) to distill 46 columns/variables into more meaningul?¿ data for the ml model..

✓ Description of how data was split into training and testing sets 

✓ Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits 

✓ Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables) 

✓ Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place 

✓ Description of current accuracy score

Additionally, the model obviously addresses
the question or problem the team is solving. 


## Dashboard
The dashboard presents a data story that is
logical and easy to follow for someone
unfamiliar with the topic. It includes all of the
following:

✓ Images from the initial analysis 
✓ Data (images or report) from the machine
learning task 
✓ At least one interactive element
